Novel and high-performance medical image classification pipelines are heavily utilizing ensemble learning strategies. The idea of ensemble learning is to assemble diverse models or multiple predictions and, thus, boost prediction performance. However, it is still an open question to what extend as well as which ensemble learning strategies are beneficial in deep learning based medical image classification pipelines.  

In this work, we proposed a reproducible medical image classification pipeline (MedIC-DeepCNN) for analyzing the performance impact of the following ensemble learning techniques: Augment
